# Data Trends (according to Claude Code AI)

Looking at the 2014-2024 data range, I can identify several significant trends in Plone's development ecosystem:

Commit Activity Patterns

Major Development Cycles:

- 2014-2015: Dramatic surge from 6,085 to 12,593 commits (+106.9%) - the largest growth in the dataset
- 2015 Peak: Highest commit activity (12,593) coinciding with Plone 5 release - major architectural overhaul
- 2016-2019: Steady decline (8,974 → 5,541 commits) - post-release stabilization and focus shift
- 2020-2021: Gradual recovery (5,745 → 6,838 commits) - renewed development momentum
- 2022 Resurgence: Second major peak (11,633 commits, +70.1% growth - Plone 6 and Volto integration
- 2023-2024: Sharp decline (8,885 → 5,992) - typical post-major-release pattern

Pull Request Evolution

Adoption Timeline:

- 2014: Only 879 PRs (14.4% of commits) - early GitHub workflow adoption
- 2015-2018: Steady growth to 2,221 PRs with increasing PR/commit ratios
- 2019: Notable dip to 1,807 PRs despite workflow maturation
- 2022-2023: Peak PR activity (2,509 → 2,600) - modern development practices fully established
- PR/Commit Ratio: Consistent upward trend from 14% (2014) to 33% (2024)
- indicating shift toward collaborative development

Development Pattern Analysis

Release-Driven Development:

1. Pre-release surge - massive development activity before major releases
2. Post-release decline - focus shifts to bug fixes and maintenance
3. Innovation periods - gradual buildup to next major version

Modernization Milestones:

- 2015 (Plone 5): Backend modernization, new theme framework, resource bundling
- 2018 (Volto/REST API): Frontend architecture revolution, React adoption
- 2022 (Plone 6): Full decoupled CMS with React frontend as default

Ecosystem Health Indicators

Positive Trends:

- Consistent PR adoption - growing collaborative development culture
- Sustained innovation cycles - regular major releases every ~4-7 years
- Technology modernization - successful transitions to modern frameworks

Development Efficiency:

- Quality over quantity - lower commit volumes but higher PR ratios
  suggest more thoughtful development
- Community maturation - established review processes and contribution
  workflows
- Architectural evolution - successful migration from monolithic to
  decoupled architecture

The data reveals Plone as a mature project with distinct development
cycles driven by major architectural innovations, showing healthy
adaptation to modern development practices while maintaining long-term stability.
